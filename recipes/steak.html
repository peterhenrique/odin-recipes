        <p> This one is a speacial honey Mustard steak</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Four 6-8 ounce boneless steaks (I like a Ribeye)</li>
            <li>Neutral oil, like avocado oil </li>
            <li>Kosher salt and fresh ground pepper</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon each mayo, honey & Dijon mustard</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li> 1 small onion, chopped fine</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/3 cup dry vermouth</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>Chopped parsley for garnish</li>
        </ul>
        <h2> Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Lightly oil the steaks, and season well with Kosher salt & pepper</li>
            <li>Heat skillet to medium and cook steaks, turning often until approximately 128-130 degrees for medium rare, or longer if you like it cooked s little more</li>
            <li> While the steaks cook, combine mayo, honey, mustard and vinegar - mix well and set aside</li>
            <li>Place steaks on plate and cover with foil to keep warm</li>
            <li>Turn the heat down slightly, add about a tablespoon more oil then put in the onions</li>
            <li>Cook a couple minutes until just beginning to soften, then add the garlic</li>
            <li>When garlic becomes very fragrant, about 45 seconds, and if doing this on a stove, remove from heat & add the vermouth, being careful cuz it could flame - then return to the stove</li>
            <li> Cook until most of the vermouth has evaporated, then add cream, honey mustard, Worcestershire and a good pinch of salt & pepper - stir well to mix and let come to a simmer until slightly thickened </li>
            <li>I like to slice the steaks and spoon the sauce over the top</li>
        </ol>
